# Scientific Calculator
In this project, I created a calculator from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
However, instead of creating a regular calculator, I chose to implement the logic behind a scientific calculator, adequately following the __order of operations__ in each calculation and allowing the user to evaluate complex operations, with parentheses and multiple operands, in one go.

## Functionalities
* The scientific calculator also works with your keyboard buttons, as well as using your mouse
* It verifies that the parentheses are correctly used, and warns the user if they made a mistake
* To avoid logical mistakes, the calculator doesn't allow the user to type incorrect operations such as starting with a multiplication symbol (*) or using two operators in a row
* If you need to delete the last number of your input, you can use your keyboard's __backspace__ key
